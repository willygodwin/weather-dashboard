# weather-dashboard
Overview - 

This week we were required to created a dynamic website that made use of a server side api's to show the weather from chosen locations. The task required the understanding of web-apis, including the use of ajax to fetch the apis and process the information and display the weather conditions. The user must specify a city in the input search box the information returned will be the current weather at that location and the 5 day forecast. The city will then be saved to the recent searches .
